Database Structure:
- You have a database with the following table:
  Table Name: LEAVEMODULE
  Columns:
    - LEAVEID (NUMBER)
    - SOLDIERID (NUMBER)
    - STATUS (VARCHAR2)
    - ONLEAVE (NUMBER) - 0 for not on leave, 1 for on leave
    - OUTTIME (TIMESTAMP) - Timestamp when marked as "Out for Leave"
    - LEAVETYPE (VARCHAR2)
    - LEAVESTARTDATE (DATE)
    - LEAVEENDDATE (DATE)

Sample Page Layout (HTML Structure):
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Leave Out Page</title>
    <!-- Include CSS and JavaScript resources if necessary -->
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Mark Soldiers Out for Leave</h1>
        <!-- Input field for soldier ID -->
        <form method="POST" action="">
            <div class="form-group">
                <label for="soldier_id">Enter Soldier ID:</label>
                <input type="text" name="soldier_id" id="soldier_id" class="form-control" required>
            </div>
            <button type="submit" name="mark_out_for_leave" class="btn btn-success">Mark Out for Leave</button>
        </form>

        <!-- Display list of approved leave records in a table -->
        <table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Leave ID</th>
                    <th>Soldier ID</th>
                    <th>Soldier Name</th>

            </thead>
            <tbody>

            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
